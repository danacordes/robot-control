Comms Protocol

This communication protocol needs to do a few things.  The primary goal of the 
app is to send control commands to the robot, and serve as a UI for display of 
status information from sensor and control systems.  The server must read in 
commands, execute them, and relay status information out form the bot to the
App.  I'll break this protocol down into CONTROL and INFO sections.  CONTROL
will consist of commands to be executed by the robot.  INFO will consist of ack
and status/sensor update info from the bot to the App.

CONTROL
****************************
All control commands should start with the letter 'C'.

Rotate Degrees
==================
CD<L|R|B><degrees>,<speed>
===================
The wheels can be rotated a specific number of degrees.  L, R, B indicate which 
wheels should be affected with B indicating both.  Degrees can be any 
positive value.  Speed can be -100 through 100, where negative values indicate
a reverse direction

Go at Speed
==================
CG<L|R|B><speed>
===================
The wheels will move at a specified rate.  L, R and B indicate which wheels
should be affected with B indicating both.  Speed can be -100 through 100 where
nevative values indicated a reverse direction

Disable Movement
==================
C-
===================
This will power down the motor controllers and set the robot so it cannot move

Enable Movement
==================
C+
===================
This will power up the motor controllers and set the robot so it can move

Function
==================
CF<index>
===================
The robot will have movement macros stored which it can replay on command.  Index
indicates which one to play

Sensor Value
==================
CN<index>
===================
The robot will be equipped with sensors.  In order to retrieve sensor data, you can 
send the CONTROL command and the index of the sensor.   

INFORMATION
****************************
All control commands should start with the letter 'I'.  The CONTROL commands will be
echoed back from the robot to indicate acknowledgement  of the control command. 
The will contain the same information set, except will be prefaced with an I instead
of a C.

Sensor Value
==================
IN<index>,<value>
===================
The robot will be equipped with sensors.  The numerical values will be indicate the
index value of the sensor.  The Value will contain the return output of the sensor.
